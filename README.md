# Blockcertify

**BlockCertify** is a decentralized application (DApp) designed for secure and efficient document verification using blockchain technology. It aims to eliminate issues like forgery, fraud, and inefficiencies in traditional verification systems by leveraging blockchainâ€™s transparency, security, and immutability.

**Key Features:**

**Admin Panel:** Institutions upload official documents with student details, and the system generates and stores cryptographic hashes of the documents on the blockchain.

**User Panel:** Users upload their documents for verification. The system checks the uploaded document's hash against the stored blockchain hash to verify authenticity.

**Smart Contracts:** These automate document verification and ensure secure interactions between users and the system.

**MetaMask Integration:** Enables secure user authentication and blockchain interaction.

**Scalability:** BlockCertify can handle large document volumes, making it ideal for academic institutions, corporations, and government use.

BlockCertify ensures a tamper-proof, transparent, and user-friendly solution for modernizing document verification processes.
